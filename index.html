                Hello! You have seemed to have stumbled upon the lair of Grothama, the Devourer of All and my website!
                Here is where I will (attempt) to go into detail on how to play Magic The Gathering(MTG for short).
            </p>

            <p>
                I will also show you what deck I use normally to play and why I play it, how to play my deck, how it works and the
                cards in it and how they synergise.
                
                <p>I finally will show and tell you why you dont always need to win and why losing is fun and good!
            </p>
