                    The reason why losing is not always a bad thing is beacause it helps show where your deck may be
                    lacking or what you need to respond to at the right time.
                </p>

                <p>
                    You might also not need any improvements for your deck as it could just be that the player you are
                    facing either has gotten lucky or they might have a stonger deck than you. Another reason why losing
                    is fun is that you may (and can!) have set up your deck to have wild cards that you dont intend to
                    win with but cause chaos and to have a laugh at the results.
