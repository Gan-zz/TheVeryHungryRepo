        <h1>Why Losing is fun!</h1>
        <p>
            The reason why losing is not always a bad thing is beacause it helps show where your deck may be lacking or
            what you need to respond to at the right time. You might also not need any improvements for your deck as it
            could just be that the player you are facing either has gotten lucky or they might have a stonger deck than
            you. Another reason why losing is fun is that you may (and can!) have set up your deck to have wild cards
            that you dont intend to win with but cause chaos and to have a laugh at the results.
