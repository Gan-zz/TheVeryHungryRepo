                <p>
                    The most common card that will show up in the deck is lands, and lands are the mana base of the deck
                    allowing you to play cards such as instants, sorceries and creature spells, and the way that you get
                    mana from lands is by tapping them
                </p>
                <p>
                    Another thing about mana is that during the different states of the turn the mana you make will be
                    lost, such as going from main phase into combat (unless you have a card that says otherwise.)
                </p>
                <p>
                    Lastly, you need the correct type of mana and enough mana in general to be able to cast a spell
                    otherwise you cannot legally cast the spell. Certain cards can reduce the cost of a spell.
